# Vizualizacija podataka

A website has been developed as the final project for the course "Data Visualization." The theme is the comparison of growth trends and relationships among children, primary and secondary school students, full-time university students, and the number of libraries in each county of the Republic of Croatia.

The website utilizes six data sets for the graphs and an additional data set for information related to the map of Croatia. Users can change the selected year using a slider, which dynamically updates the information on the graphs and the colors on the map to reflect the number of the selected category in all counties. By selecting a county and up to two data sets, users can view growth trends over all available years for the chosen county and categories.
